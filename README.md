# Simple Todo List App

This is a beginner-friendly todo list application that helps you keep track of your tasks.

## What Can It Do?
- Add new tasks
- View all your tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- Saves your tasks so they're not lost when you close the program

## How to Use
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Run the program by typing:
   ```
   python todo.py
   ```
3. Follow the menu options:
   - Press 1 to add a task
   - Press 2 to view all tasks
   - Press 3 to mark a task as done
   - Press 4 to delete a task
   - Press 5 to exit

## How It Works
- The program uses a simple JSON file (`tasks.json`) to save your tasks
- Each task has two properties:
  - The task text (what you need to do)
  - A done status (whether it's completed or not)
- The checkmark (âœ“) shows when a task is done
